# Summary
This lab includes the creation of an `About` page and a `Contact` page.

Most of the bootstrap was already done in a previous lab. A few things have changed such as the color of the nav bar to grey and the text 'Welcome to' in the hero section of the main page.

A model was created in the modal folder for the contact form. 

A Controller was created by both creating a custom one as instructed in the lab and an auto generated CRUD app through visual studio. The one presented in the app is the one required in the lab. I believe the form works on submission but did not create a way to verify this. The form works on the CRUD app.

I also created new a new logo and custom created all the bootstrap on the new pages.
